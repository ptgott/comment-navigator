# ROADMAP

## Doing now

## Features
- Filter comment threads by last user
- Filter comment threads by whether it's a comment/suggestion
- Filter comment threads by body text search term (JS regexp)
- Count all comments by filter within the UI
- Prev/Next buttons in the UI

## Deployment
- Determine how to run this. Consider making it an add-on: https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/how-tos/building-editor-addons. Or make it a userscript for Tampermonkey etc.

## Tooling
- Set up a build script with TypeScript and WebPack
