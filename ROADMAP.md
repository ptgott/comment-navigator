# ROADMAP

## Doing now

## Features
- Add unit tests for `NavigatorComponent` functions.
- Add a way of tracking the currently selected comment thread (use a filter based on a selector?)
- Prev/Next buttons (for navigation across filtered threads) in the UI component

## Deployment
- Determine how to run this. Consider making it an add-on: https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/how-tos/building-editor-addons. Or make it a userscript for Tampermonkey etc.

## Tooling
- Start using Prettier
- Set up a build script with TypeScript and WebPack
