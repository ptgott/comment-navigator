# ROADMAP

## Doing now

## Features

- Get to 100% test coverage.
- Allow the main calling context--which calls FilterCollection.use()--to read user menu selections from the UI components. Do this periodically before refreshing.
- Slider for comment navigation. Each stop becomes another comment. Start by dispatching a click for every stop

## Tooling

- Set up test debugging with Jest and VSCode
- Set up a build script with TypeScript and WebPack

## Deployment

- Determine how to run this. Consider making it an add-on: https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/how-tos/building-editor-addons. Or make it a userscript for Tampermonkey etc.
