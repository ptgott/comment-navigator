# Google Docs comment navigator

## What is this?

A tool for making it easier to manage comments and suggestions in Google Docs. After the first draft, most of the work you put into writing goes into responding to comments. This tool helps you estimate the work you'll need to address feedback and triage your work effectively.

## Contributing

- We use Prettier for formatting. If you're using VSCode, `.vscode/settings.json` configures Prettier to format on save.
- We use Jest for testing. Run `npm test` to run tests. `npm run coverage` also runs the tests, then opens Jest's code coverage report in your browser. Use this when you want to plan the next tests to write.
