# Data to be transformed into MockCommentThreads and MockSuggestionThreads.
# This approach makes it easier for the e2e tests to identify expected
# conditions without having to repeat the business logic of the
# comment navigator itself.

# IMPORTANT: e2e tests depend on the precise order and content of this
# fixture. Be sure to run the e2e tests before and after changing the fixture
# to ensure nothing breaks.
